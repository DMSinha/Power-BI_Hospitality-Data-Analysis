Hospitality Data Analysis

<b>Problem statement</b>
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

<b>Insights Drawn:</b><br>
1. The Average Daily Rate weekly graph is a straight line in the "Trend By Key Metrics" Chart. Also, "ADR by Day Type" does not reflect the major difference in weekday & weekend pricing of AtliQ Hotel Grands.<br>
   This showcases the opportunity to change the Pricing Strategy for weekday & weekend price hotels.<br>

2. Also, there seems some opportunity, to increase sales through direct online platforms, by offering promo code-based discounts.<br>
   
4. Also, in the city-wise comparisons, it is noticeable that although Delhi is highest in occupancy %, it is lowest in revenue. This again gives space to making some changes in the pricing strategy at Delhi.<br>
